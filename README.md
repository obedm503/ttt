# ttt

tic tac toe in a few languages

## Languages

- [x] C
- [x] Rust
- [x] Java
- [x] TypeScript
- [x] Python
- [ ] Go?

I'm writing `ttt` out of curiosity and to get my feet wet in other languages.
This project serves as a good way for me to compare how how different languages
feel when writing CLI programs.
